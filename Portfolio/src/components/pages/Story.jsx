        I think every pixel is a story, and I love bringing those stories to life through design and web development. My love for music, games, and storytelling drives my imagination. With a passion for creativity and a touch of magic, my goal is to create memorable experiences that not only bring joy but also inspire.

        My web development journey started when I was younger, helping my brother make assets for an indie game. That was the start of my interest in 3D an graphic design and knowing it was something I could do as a job later in life inspired me. I have always loved video games and nerdy stuff like Dungeons and Dragons always got my creative juices flowing. There's something special about making your own world that intrigued me. I enjoy making intricate things for others to decipher and be surprised by. The best thing about web development is the endless possibility of what can be accomplished through the screen. I want to make something unique that people can hold close to their hearts and maybe even change their minds about how they see the world.

          <em>A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world. The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work.</em>
